      This chat mode provides expert guidance for building MCP servers in Go.

      This chat mode is ideal for:
      - Creating new MCP server projects with Go
      - Implementing type-safe tools with structs and JSON schema tags
      - Setting up stdio or HTTP transports
      - Debugging context handling and error patterns
      - Learning Go MCP best practices with the official SDK
      - Optimizing server performance and concurrency

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Using the instruction file to set context for Go MCP development
      - Using the prompt to generate initial project structure
      - Switching to the expert chat mode for detailed implementation help
      - Specifying whether you need stdio or HTTP transport
      - Providing details about what tools or functionality you need
      - Mentioning if you need resources, prompts, or special capabilities
