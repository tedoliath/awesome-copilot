      This chat mode provides expert guidance for building MCP servers in Kotlin.

      This chat mode is ideal for:
      - Creating new MCP server projects with Kotlin
      - Implementing type-safe tools with coroutines and kotlinx.serialization
      - Setting up stdio or SSE transports with Ktor
      - Debugging coroutine patterns and JSON schema issues
      - Learning Kotlin MCP best practices with the official SDK
      - Building multiplatform MCP servers (JVM, Wasm, iOS)

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Using the instruction file to set context for Kotlin MCP development
      - Using the prompt to generate initial project structure with Gradle
      - Switching to the expert chat mode for detailed implementation help
      - Specifying whether you need stdio or SSE/HTTP transport
      - Providing details about what tools or functionality you need
      - Mentioning if you need multiplatform support or specific targets
