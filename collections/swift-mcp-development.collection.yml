      This chat mode provides expert guidance for building MCP servers in Swift.

      This chat mode is ideal for:
      - Creating new MCP server projects with Swift
      - Implementing async/await patterns and actor-based concurrency
      - Setting up stdio, HTTP, or network transports
      - Debugging Swift concurrency and ServiceLifecycle integration
      - Learning Swift MCP best practices with the official SDK
      - Optimizing server performance for iOS/macOS platforms

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Using the instruction file to set context for Swift MCP development
      - Using the prompt to generate initial project structure
      - Switching to the expert chat mode for detailed implementation help
      - Specifying whether you need stdio, HTTP, or network transport
      - Providing details about what tools or functionality you need
      - Mentioning if you need resources, prompts, or special capabilities
